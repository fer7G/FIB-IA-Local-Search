# FIB-IA-Local-Search
This project was made for the Local Seach practice of the Artifficial Intelligence (IA) 22-23 Q2 course of FIB-UPC. This repository only includes temporally the report of the practice, the code will be visible at the end of the course. In the report we explain the problem proposed (optimizing a carsharing system), how did we tackle it and some experiments.
